                  Over the years, we've worked with amazing people‚Äîand also burned out trying to build with the wrong ones. 
                  We kept thinking: What if there were a smarter way to find the right collaborators? Not just based on skills, 
                  but on energy, intention, and mission.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was born from that idea: that good people doing good work shouldn't have to build in isolation. 
                  With the right collaboration, momentum follows.

                Everyone has ideas. Some are sparks of creativity, others are deeply personal missions. 
                But no matter the scale, ideas don't grow in isolation. They grow with people.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here, we believe that if your idea can improve life, even in a small way, it's worth building. 
                And if you're someone who wants to help bring those ideas to life, you're just as important.

                and want to create something meaningful.
